- **Worker Registration**: Qu·∫£n l√Ω Worker Agent registration
- **Load Balancing**: Ph√¢n ph·ªëi jobs d·ª±a tr√™n worker capacity
- **Execution Tracking**: Theo d√µi job assignments v·ªõi checkpoint data

---

- **Health Monitoring**: Track Worker Agent heartbeats
- **Failure Detection**: Detect inactive workers (60s timeout)
- **Job Reassignment**: Reassign jobs from failed workers to healthy workers
- **Worker Registration**: Manage Worker Agent registration
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute jobs based on worker capacity
- **Execution Tracking**: Track job assignments with checkpoint data

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Heartbeat Monitor

```java
@Scheduled(fixedRate = 30000) // Every 30 seconds
public void monitorWorkerHealth() {
    // 1. Get all registered workers
    // 2. Check last_heartbeat_time
    // 3. If (now - last_heartbeat > 60s):
    //    - Mark worker as UNHEALTHY
    //    - Trigger job reassignment
}
```

### 2. Job Reassignment Engine

```java
public void reassignJobsFromFailedWorker(String failedWorkerId) {
    // 1. Get all RUNNING jobs assigned to failed worker
    // 2. Get available healthy workers
    // 3. For each job:
    //    a. Select worker with lowest load
    //    b. Load checkpoint data
    //    c. Reassign job to new worker
    //    d. Update execution assignment
    //    e. Dispatch to new worker
}
```

### 3. Worker Registry

```java
public class WorkerRegistry {
    // Maintains:
    // - Worker ID ‚Üí Worker metadata
    // - Worker status (ONLINE/UNHEALTHY/OFFLINE)
    // - Last heartbeat timestamp
    // - Current capacity and load
    // - Assigned jobs
}
```

### 4. Execution Assignment Tracker

```java
public class ExecutionAssignment {
    // Tracks:
    // - Job ID ‚Üí Worker ID mapping
    // - Assignment timestamp
    // - Checkpoint data
    // - Reassignment history
}
```

    "usedCapacity": 35,
    "reassignmentEvents": 12
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Health Monitoring Flow

```
1. Worker Agent sends heartbeat (every 30 seconds)
   POST /api/execution-coordinator/workers/{workerId}/heartbeat
   {
     "currentLoad": 5,
     "capacity": 10,
     "status": "ONLINE"
   }

2. Execution Coordinator updates last_heartbeat_time
   UPDATE workers 
   SET last_heartbeat_time = NOW(), 
       current_load = 5,
       status = 'ONLINE'
   WHERE worker_id = 'agent-1'

3. Health Monitor checks periodically (every 30 seconds)
   SELECT * FROM workers 
   WHERE last_heartbeat_time < (NOW() - INTERVAL '60 seconds')

4. If worker timeout detected:
   a. Mark worker as UNHEALTHY
   b. Get all jobs assigned to this worker
   c. Trigger job reassignment

5. Job Reassignment Process:
   a. Query: SELECT * FROM job_executions 
            WHERE worker_id = 'failed-worker' 
            AND status = 'RUNNING'
   
   b. For each running job:
      - Load checkpoint data
      - Find healthy worker with capacity
      - Update job assignment
      - Dispatch to new worker with checkpoint
   
   c. Log reassignment event
```

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven 3.6+
- Job Store Service running (port 8081)
- Worker Agent(s) running (port 8084)

### Build
```bash
cd execution-coordinator
mvn clean install
```

### Run
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Service s·∫Ω ch·∫°y tr√™n **http://localhost:8085**

### Run with Custom Configuration
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run \
  -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--execution.coordinator.heartbeat-timeout=60000"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```yaml
server:
  port: 8085

spring:
  application:
    name: execution-coordinator

execution:
  coordinator:
    heartbeat-check-interval: 30000  # 30 seconds
    heartbeat-timeout: 60000         # 60 seconds
    reassignment-enabled: true
    max-reassignment-attempts: 3
    job-store-url: http://localhost:8081
```

## üîë Key Features

### 1. Automatic Failure Detection

```
Timeline:
T=0s   : Worker sends heartbeat ‚úì
T=30s  : Worker sends heartbeat ‚úì
T=60s  : Worker sends heartbeat ‚úì
T=90s  : Worker crash ‚úó
T=120s : Coordinator checks - last heartbeat at T=60s
         (120 - 60 = 60s > timeout)
         ‚Üí Mark UNHEALTHY
         ‚Üí Trigger reassignment
```

### 2. Smart Job Reassignment

```java
// Select best worker for reassignment
Worker selectWorker(List<Worker> healthyWorkers) {
    return healthyWorkers.stream()
        .filter(w -> w.getStatus() == ONLINE)
        .filter(w -> w.getCurrentLoad() < w.getCapacity())
        .min(Comparator.comparing(w -> 
            w.getCurrentLoad() / (double) w.getCapacity()
        ))
        .orElse(null);
}
```

**Criteria:**
- Worker must be ONLINE
- Worker must have available capacity
- Prefer worker with lowest load %
- Round-robin if multiple workers equal

### 3. Checkpoint-Based Resume

```java
// Reassign with checkpoint
JobDispatchEvent createReassignmentEvent(Job job, String checkpointData) {
    return JobDispatchEvent.builder()
        .jobId(job.getId())
        .jobName(job.getJobName())
        .payload(job.getPayload())
        .checkpointData(checkpointData)  // Resume from checkpoint
        .isReassignment(true)
        .previousWorkerId(job.getWorkerId())
        .build();
}
```

### 4. Reassignment History Tracking

```java
@Entity
public class ReassignmentEvent {
    private Long jobId;
    private String fromWorkerId;
    private String toWorkerId;
    private Instant reassignedAt;
    private String reason;
    private String checkpointData;
}
```

## üìä Service Dependencies

```
Execution Coordinator ‚Üê Worker Agent (heartbeat)
Execution Coordinator ‚Üí Worker Agent (job reassignment)
Execution Coordinator ‚Üí Job Store Service (query jobs, update status)
```

### Required Services
1. **Job Store Service** (8081): Job and execution data
2. **Worker Agent** (8084): Target for reassignment

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### 1. Normal Heartbeat Test

```bash
# Register worker
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workerId": "agent-1",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8084,
    "capacity": 10
  }'

# Send heartbeat every 30 seconds
while true; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1/heartbeat \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "currentLoad": 5,
      "capacity": 10,
      "status": "ONLINE"
    }'
  sleep 30
done

# Check worker status
curl http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1
```

### 2. Worker Failure & Reassignment Test

```bash
# Step 1: Register two workers
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workerId": "agent-1", "host": "localhost", "port": 8084, "capacity": 10}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workerId": "agent-2", "host": "localhost", "port": 8184, "capacity": 10}'

# Step 2: Dispatch job to agent-1
# (via Scheduler Worker)

# Step 3: Verify job is running on agent-1
curl http://localhost:8081/api/executions?workerId=agent-1

# Step 4: Stop agent-1 heartbeat (simulate crash)
# Stop sending heartbeats

# Step 5: Wait 60+ seconds

# Step 6: Check worker status (should be UNHEALTHY)
curl http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1

# Step 7: Check job reassignment (should be on agent-2)
curl http://localhost:8081/api/executions?jobId={id}
# workerId should change from agent-1 to agent-2
```

### 3. Load Balancing Test

```bash
# Register 3 workers with different loads
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1/heartbeat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"currentLoad": 8, "capacity": 10, "status": "ONLINE"}'  # 80% load

curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-2/heartbeat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"currentLoad": 3, "capacity": 10, "status": "ONLINE"}'  # 30% load

curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-3/heartbeat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"currentLoad": 5, "capacity": 10, "status": "ONLINE"}'  # 50% load

# Trigger reassignment
# New jobs should go to agent-2 (lowest load %)
```

### 4. Graceful Shutdown Test

```bash
# Worker announces shutdown
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers/agent-1

# Coordinator should:
# 1. Mark worker as OFFLINE
# 2. Wait for running jobs to complete (or reassign immediately)
# 3. Remove from available workers pool
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Key Metrics

1. **Worker Health**
   - Online workers count
   - Unhealthy workers count
   - Average heartbeat latency
   - Heartbeat miss rate

2. **Reassignment Stats**
   - Total reassignments
   - Reassignments per hour
   - Reassignment success rate
   - Average reassignment time

3. **Capacity Utilization**
   - Total system capacity
   - Used capacity
   - Available capacity
   - Per-worker utilization %

4. **Failure Detection**
   - Worker failure detection time
   - False positive rate
   - Time to reassignment

### Health Dashboard
```bash
# System overview
curl http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/health

# Worker list
curl http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers

# Reassignment history
curl http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/reassignments?limit=20
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workers Marked as UNHEALTHY Incorrectly

**Possible Causes:**
1. Network latency
2. Heartbeat timeout too aggressive
3. Worker overloaded (can't send heartbeat)

**Solutions:**
```yaml
# Increase heartbeat timeout
execution:
  coordinator:
    heartbeat-timeout: 90000  # 90 seconds instead of 60
```

### Issue: Jobs Not Being Reassigned

**Possible Causes:**
1. No healthy workers available
2. All workers at capacity
3. Reassignment disabled in config
4. Job Store Service unavailable

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check available workers
curl http://localhost:8085/api/execution-coordinator/workers

# Check reassignment configuration
# Enable reassignment in application.yml

# Check Job Store Service
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
```

### Issue: Repeated Reassignments (Ping-Pong)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Worker comes back online quickly
2. Network flapping
3. Insufficient timeout margin

**Solutions:**
```yaml
# Increase timeout and add grace period
execution:
  coordinator:
    heartbeat-timeout: 90000
    reassignment-grace-period: 30000  # Wait 30s before reassigning
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Heartbeat Timeout**: Should be at least 2x heartbeat interval
2. **Database Consistency**: Use transactions for reassignment
3. **Checkpoint Data**: Critical for resuming long-running jobs
4. **Load Balancing**: Consider worker capacity and current load
5. **False Positives**: Network issues can cause false failures
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers should deregister before stopping
7. **Monitoring**: Alert on high reassignment rate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rules

**MANDATORY**:
- ‚úÖ Check heartbeat timeout before marking UNHEALTHY
- ‚úÖ Validate worker capacity before reassignment
- ‚úÖ Load checkpoint data for reassigned jobs
- ‚úÖ Update job execution records atomically
- ‚úÖ Log all reassignment events for audit
- ‚úÖ Handle reassignment failures gracefully
- ‚ùå KH√îNG reassign jobs v·ªõi status != RUNNING
- ‚ùå KH√îNG reassign t·ªõi UNHEALTHY workers
- ‚ùå KH√îNG skip checkpoint data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use pessimistic locking for concurrent reassignments
