# Distributed Job Scheduler - Spring Boot Microservices

A scalable distributed job scheduling system built with Spring Boot microservices architecture. The system can handle millions of tasks, ensure high availability, and prevent single points of failure through segment-based partitioning and leader election.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project implements a distributed job scheduler consisting of **5 microservices**:

### Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **job-store-service** | 8081 | Centralized persistence layer for jobs, schedules, executions, and workers |
| **scheduler-coordinator** | 8082 | Orchestrates scheduler workers with leader election and segment assignment |
| **scheduler-worker** | 8083 | Scans job schedules by segments and dispatches jobs |
| **worker-agent** | 8084 | Executes jobs with concurrency control |
| **execution-coordinator** | 8085 | Monitors worker health and handles job reassignment on failures |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven 3.6+

### Build All Services
```bash
cd /home/engine/project
mvn clean install
```

### Run Services

Each service can be run independently:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Job Store Service
cd job-store-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2 - Scheduler Coordinator
cd scheduler-coordinator
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 3 - Scheduler Worker
cd scheduler-worker
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 4 - Worker Agent
cd worker-agent
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 5 - Execution Coordinator
cd execution-coordinator
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 📖 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `guide/` folder:

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./guide/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Original Spring Boot architecture patterns
- **[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./guide/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Development workflow and coding standards
- **[API_PATTERNS.md](./guide/API_PATTERNS.md)** - API design and response patterns
- **[CONFIGURATION.md](./guide/CONFIGURATION.md)** - Configuration and deployment guide

## 🔑 Key Features

### Scalability
- **Segment-based partitioning** (100 segments: 0-99) for horizontal scaling
- Multiple coordinator nodes with leader election
- Multiple scheduler workers and worker agents
- Each handles specific job segments

### High Availability
- **No single point of failure** through leader election
- Worker health monitoring with heartbeat mechanism
- Automatic job reassignment on worker failure
- Fault-tolerant job execution

### Consistency
- Idempotent job dispatching via dispatch records
- Segment-based job ownership prevents duplication
- Status tracking for each execution
- Checkpoint support for retries

### Performance
- Configurable concurrency per worker
- Periodic scanning (60s for scheduling, 30s for health monitoring)
- Direct REST API communication
- H2 in-memory database for development

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 1. Submit a Job
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jobName": "Test Job",
    "userId": 1,
    "frequency": "ONE_TIME",
    "executionTime": "2024-12-31T10:00:00Z",
    "payload": "Job payload data",
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "segment": 5
  }'
```

### 2. Register Scheduler Worker
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8082/api/scheduler-workers/register?workerId=worker-1"
```

### 3. Assign Segments
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8082/api/segments/assign?workerId=worker-1&desiredSegments=10"
```

### 4. Check Job Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/jobs/1
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Spring Boot 3.3.4** - Application framework
- **Java 21** - Programming language
- **H2 Database** - In-memory database (development)
- **PostgreSQL** - Recommended for production
- **Maven** - Build tool
- **Lombok** - Code generation
- **MapStruct** - Object mapping

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **jobs** - Job metadata (name, frequency, payload, status, retry count)
- **job_schedules** - Scheduling data with next_run_time and segment
- **job_executions** - Execution history with checkpoint data
- **workers** - Worker registration and capacity
- **worker_heartbeats** - Worker health tracking

### Design Principles
- **No JPA relationships** - Only ID references for simplicity
- Service layer coordination for related data
- Flat entity model for easier maintenance

## 🔄 System Flow

```
1. Job Submission
   Client → Job Store Service → Creates Job + Schedule

2. Job Scheduling
   Scheduler Worker → Job Store Service → Get due jobs for segments
   Scheduler Worker → Publishes job dispatch event
   Scheduler Worker → Updates job status to SCHEDULED

3. Job Execution
   Worker Agent → Receives job dispatch event
   Worker Agent → Executes job (with concurrency control)
   Worker Agent → Updates job status (RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED)

4. Health Monitoring
   Execution Coordinator → Monitors worker heartbeats
   Execution Coordinator → Detects failures → Reassigns jobs
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Kafka integration for job dispatch events
- Job prioritization with priority queues
- Job dependencies and workflow support
- Rate limiting at client and queue levels
- Prometheus metrics and distributed tracing
- Full checkpoint/resume implementation
- Backpressure handling
- Dead letter queue for failed jobs
